# taimingwang.github.io: my homepage

the homepage contains following parts:

Index link to *cv* and *teaching*. 

CV folder has pdf version of resume. In cv folder I shall directly compile pdf from .tex, but ignore .tex file when push to github.

All papers should link to Researchgate or publisher. Another pdf file is needed in my website.
